## Summary

ICS3C and ICS4C courses were combined and connected to an Introduction to Python Programming dual credit course at Durham College

## Description

My resource features the two major culminating task assignments (1 and 2) that were completed by the students in the dual credit course and laid the foundation for topics that would be covered in the final exam. I have included 2 student coding responses to the Assignment 2 challenge to give some idea of the student's response to the college-level programming task. This spring, I enrolled in an ethical hacking course at Durham College and I've included the pen testing lab (Lab ##5) that we had to complete which showcases how cybersecurity can be taught using Virtual Box.
